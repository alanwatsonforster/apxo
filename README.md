Glass is a partial implementation of JD Webster's “Air Power” rules for modern air-combat gaming, originally published in the games “Air Superiority”, “Air Strike”, “Desert Falcons”, “Eagles of the Gulf”, and "The Speed of Heat".

It is intended to run in a Python notebook (for example, a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) running in a web browser) and frees the players from much of the mechanical work associated with flight, allowing them to concentrate on the tactics and combat.
