# Original Games

## Games and Modules

*Glass* is based on a series of jet combat games and modules originally designed by JD Webster. They were hex-grid-and-counter games, in the tradition of 1970s and 1980s board war games. One significant innovation was allowing to aircraft and missiles to move onto hex-sides.

### *Air Superiority*

*Air Superiority* was published by GDW in 1987. This game covered air-to-air combat mainly between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in the 1980s and 1990s with historical scenarios involving clashes between the USA and Libya, Israel and Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and hypothetical scenarios involving NATO, the Warsaw Pact, Austria, Libya, and Sweden, Iraq and Kuwait, and Jordan and Syria.

### *Air Strike*

*Air Strike* was published by GDW in 1987. This module extended *Air Superiority* to include air-to-ground and ground-to-air combat in the 1980s and 1990s mainly between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

### *Desert Falcons*

*Desert Falcons* was published by GDW in 1988. This module extended *Air Superiority* to air-to-air combat in wars in the Arab-Israeli Wars from the 1950s to the 1980s.

### *Eagles of the Gulf*

*Eagles of the Gulf* was published in three parts: part I was published in issue 9 of *Battleplan* magazine in 1989 and parts IIA and IIB were published in *Air Power Journal* issues 11 and 12 in 1990. (An explanation for this appears in issue 11 of *Air Power*.) This module extended *Air Superiority*, *Air Strike*, and *Desert Falcons* to cover air-to-ground and ground-to-air combat mainly in the Arab-Israeli Wars, the Aden Emergency, and the North Yemen Civil War from the 1950s to 1970s.

### *The Speed of Heat*

*The Speed of Heat* was published by Clash of Arms in 1992. This game covered air-to-air, air-to-ground, and ground-to-air combat from the 1950s to 1970s, in the context of the Korean War, the Cold War and Vietnam War.

## *Air Power Journal*

JD Webster also published 55 editions of *Air Power Journal* from 1989 to 1998 focused on his jet games but also later on his WWII games. These contain additional aircraft data cards, scenarios, rule clarifications and errata, discussions of tactics in the game, historical articles, and the entire *Eagles of the Gulf* module (in issues 11 and 12).

## Rules

The original *Air Superiority* rules were extended in *Air Strike* and then modified slightly by *Desert Falcons* and *Eagles of the Gulf*.

JD Webster rewrote and revised the rules for *The Speed of Heat*, describing them as version 1 of the *Air Power* rules. He published a list of errata in issue 23 of *Air Power Journal* journal.  Felix Hack wrote a list of clarifications that appeared in issue 36 of *Air Power Journal* journal.

Throughout the 1990s, there was mention of a forthcoming version 2. Proposed new rules were described briefly in issues 39, 41, and 53 of *Air Power Journal*. However, no final version was ever published.

Malcolm “Puma” Pipes has published an updated version of the *Air Power* rules to the *Air Power* group. These are labeled as version 2.4. I cannot find a list of changes, but these rules seem to be the version 1 rules with the official errata and the rules from issue 53 of *Air Power Journal*.
