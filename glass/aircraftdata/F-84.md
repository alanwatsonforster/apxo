## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

Original ADCs for F-84E/G from TSOH.

### Guns

Six .50 cal M3 guns each with 300 rounds (Wikipedia). Specified as M3 in [2261538](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/2261538f1aad8ceb7c10520a94e0a1ccf0629e24).

### Radar

Radar is APG-30 (Wikipedia). Added in [a7bfe91](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/a7bfe91ab4b0e7addfc9592e911c051cb3620d36).

### Fuel

F-84D SAC:
 - 165 gal wings
 - 256 gal fuselage
 - 370 gal (2 x 185 gal) wing drop tanks
 - internal = 421 gal = 2736 lb @ 6.5 lb/gal
 - internal + wing-tip tanks = 791 gal = 5141 @ 6.5 lb/gal

F-84E SAC:
  - 162 gal wings
  - 290 gal fuselage
  - 920 gal drop tanks (4 x 230 gal)
  - internal = 418 gal = 2842 lb @ 6.8 lb/gal
  - internal + wing-tip tanks = 878 gal = 5970 lb @ 6.8 lb/gal
  - internal + wing-tip tanks + inner-wing tanks = 1338 gal = 9098 lb @ 6.8 lb/gal

F-84G Handbook:
  - The tip-tanks were jettisonable (p. 9)

Wikipedia/Goebel:
- F-84E: Wing-tip tanks are 226 gal (850L). 
- F-84E: Under-wing stations can carry 230 gal (850L) FTs.

### Air-to-Air Refueling

Cleaver, ch. 13: F-84E could be equipped with an air-to-air refueling probe. This was used in May 1952 to strike targets in North Korea from Japan. Refueling was provided by B-29 tankers. The load was two 500 lb bombs.

### Loads

Cleaver:
- ch. 3: underwing pylons could carry 2000 lb; flush-fitting rocket racks.
- ch. 13: two 500 lb or two 1000 lb bombs.

Goebel: 
- F-84E could carry 4500 lb
- F-84E used rockets, bombs, and napalm
- F-84E was at the limit with two 1000 lb bombs
- F-84G could carry 4000 lb of conventional ordnance
- F-84G could use the 1200 lb Mk 7 tactical nuclear bomb and had LABS for toss bombing.

Jackson:
- p. 67: photo of 1000 lb bomb (size of man) being loaded onto an F-84
- p. 69: photo of F-84 with two 500 lb bombs
- p. 89: photo of F-84 with two 1000? lb bombs (despite the caption)
- p. 109: photo of F-84 with two 1000? lb bombs

Wikipedia:
- 4000 lb or bombs
- Up to 32 HVARs
- One Mk 7 nuclear bomb (Wikipedia). I presume on stations 4 or 5.

F-84D SAC:
- Max Bomb load 2000 lb: 2 x 1000/500/250/100 lb GB or 2 x 350 DB
- 300 rounds per gun
- 8 HVARs
- Wing-tip tanks are 185 gal (700L) each = 1300 lb
- The "Attack Mission" profile shows full fuel load (5141 lb) including wing-tip tanks plus 2 x 1000 lb bombs, 8 HVARs, and 540 lb of ammunition (3660 total). Load excluding wing-tip tanks and ammunition is 3120 lb. Load including wing-tip tanks and excluding ammunition is 5720 lb.

F-84E SAC:
- Max Bomb load 2000 lb: 2 x 1000/500/250/100 lb GB or 2 x 350 DB
- 300 rounds per gun
- 8 HVARs or 24 HVARs on -20 and later
- Wing-tip (and under-wing) tanks are 230 gal (850L) each = 1500 lb
- The "Attack Mission" profile shows a fuel load of 6202 lb or 912 gal (at 6.8 lb/gal) which corresponds to the internal fuel plus two drop tanks and 3120 lb of military load (2 x 1000 lb bomb and 8 x HVAR). I presume the weight of the gun ammunition is included elsewhere. Load including wing-tip tanks is 6120 lb.
- The "penetration mission" has four tanks and (presumably) full gun ammunition, but no other load. This would be a load of 6000 lb.

TSOH ADC:
- Load limit of 4500 lb.
- The load limits of the wing-tip stations are given as 1700 in the TSOH errata.
- The load limits of the inner-wing stations are given as 1700.
- The load limits of the outer-wing stations are given as 420.
- Two 850L FTs on the wing tips (3000) and either two 850L FTs or two 1000 lb bombs on the under-wing stations (3000 or 2000) would exceed the stated load limit, yet these are known loads.
- Two 850L FTs on the wing tips (3000) leaves only 1500 lb for ordnance. This is two 500 lb bombs or ten HVARs.

I suspect that the load of the wing-tip tanks are implicitly not included in the TSOH ADC.

### Number of HVARs

SAC says up to 24 on F-84E-20 and later

- [Photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/27862259@N02/6102930909/) shows 3 x HVARs on stations 2/3/6/7, 6 x HVARs on 1/8, and 1 x Tiny Tim on 4/5 = 24 HVARs
- [Photo](https://media.defense.gov/2008/Feb/27/2000572000/-1/-1/0/050421-F-1234P-004.JPG) shows 3 x HVARs on stations 2/3/6/7, 4 x HVARs on 1/8, and 4 x HVAR on 4/5 = 28 HVARS. This matches the TSOH ADC.
- [Photo](https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Upcoming/Photos/igphoto/2000544589/) shows 3 x HVARs on stations 2/3/6/7, 1 x Tiny Tim on 4/5, and no wing-tip tanks.
- [Photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31st_Fighter_Wing#/media/File:31st_FEW_Republic_F-84G-1-RE_Thunderjet_51-821.jpg) shows F-84G with 4 HVARs on 4/5, 3 on 2/3/6/7, and 6 on 1/8 = 32 total

TSOH ADC for F-84E/G:
- Wing-tip stations 1 and 8 can carry 4 RK each.
- Outer-wing stations 2-3 and 6-7 can carry 3 RK each
- Inner-wing stations 4 and 5 can carry 4 RK each
- Total is 28 HVAR

I have found no evidence for HVARs on stations 1/4/5/8 in Korea.

### Stations and Load Limits

Stations and load limits for F-84D should be:

- Load limit: 5720 lb
- 1 and 8: 1300 lb: 185 gal (700L) FT
- 2-3 and 6-7: 280 lb: 1/2 x HVAR
- 4 and 5: 1300 lb: 185 gal (700L) FT or 1000 lb BB

This allows the "attack mission" load (5720 lb) from the SAC.

Stations and load limits for F-84E should be:

- Load limit: 6120 lb
- 1 and 8: 1500 lb: 230 gal (850L) FT or 4/6 x HVAR
- 2-3 and 6-7: 520 lb: 1/2/3 x HVAR
- 4 and 5: 1500 lb: 230 gal (850L) FT or 1000 lb BB or 4 x HVAR

This allows both the "attack mission" (6120 lb) and "penetration mission" (6000 lb) from the SAC.

Stations and load limits for F-84G should be:

- Load limit: 6200 lb
- 1 and 8: 1500 lb: 230 gal (850L) FT or 4/6 x HVAR
- 2-3 and 6-7: 520 lb: 1/2/3 x HVAR
- 4 and 5: 1700 lb: 230 gal (850L) FT or 1000 lb BB or 4 x HVAR or 1 x Mk 7 nuclear bomb

The increase in the load limit and the station limit for stations 4 and 5 allows carrying 3 x 250 gl (850L) FTs and 1 x Mk 7 nuclear bomb.

Changed in [f33fef7](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/f33fef7d85d19bde1950394b93edb1c9a4922114).

#### Configuration Limits

TSOH ADC:
- CL = 0-4
- 1/2 = 5-12
- DT = 13+

Let's first consider the F-80C. With full/empty wing-tip 600L FTs only, it has 6/4 load points and its configuration is 1/2. This gives it a reason to jettison the FTs before air-to-air combat.

Now let's consider the F-84E. With full/empty wing-tip 850L FTs only, it has 7/5 load points and its configuration is 1/2. Again, that gives it a reason to jettison FTs.

### Reconnaissance Pods

Gobel: Wing-tip tanks could be replaced by camera pods. Used by Belgium (G), Denmark (G), France (G), Italy (G), Netherlands (E), Norway (E), and Yugoslavia (G).

## Other Possible Variants

### F-84D

Cleaver (ch. 13) states that 102 F-84Ds were sent to Korea in 1952 and were used by the 136th Wing from April to October 1952.
