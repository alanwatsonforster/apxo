## Notes and Changes

### B-29A

This ADC is for a B-29A conventional bomber at the start of the 1950s. The tail 20 mm has been replaced by a third .50 cal, but otherwise it is almost unchanged from the WW2 version.

### B-29A (Silverplate)

This ADC is for a B-29A Silverplate strategic nuclear bomber at the start of the 1950s. The last Silverplate was retired from this role in November 1951.

### B-29A (SaddleTree)


Additional conventional B-29As were converted to nuclear bombers, similar to the B-29 SaddleTree aircraft, in 1948 and 1949. About half of the SaddleTree B-29As were fitted with air-to-air refueling and winterized electronics in the RURALIST program in 1948 and 1949.

## RB-29A

B-29A with additional photo-recconnaisance equipment.

### In TSOH

The B-29 is presented scenario K-4 of TSOH as an aircraft with special flight rules:

 - EZ turns only.
 - Slide maneuvers only
 - Moves at speed 3.0 or 2.0, if H or C damaged.
 - Gain 0.2 or lose 1.0 altitudes per turn at no cost in FPs.
 - Visibility = 10
 - Vulnerability = +2
 - Size = -2
 - Ceiling = 40
 - Defensive guns with to-hit rolls of 2/1/1, modified by -1 if firing in the 60- arc, target size, and -1 for each additional bomber attacking. Attack rating = 2. Unlimited ammunition. Defensive guns can fire twice per turn, but only once offensively.

### Flight Characteristics

I have created an ADC to allow it to be used with normal flight rules. It gives very similar performance, except that when climbing one FP is used as a VFP rather than a HFP.

- Restrictions. UD, VD, ZC, and VC are forbidden. SC and SD may only use 1 VFP per turn. SD may only lose 1 altitude level per VFP. 

- I originally include that power is limited level N (i.e., cruise speed in level flight) with H or C damage. However, I removed it in [b2261d4](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/b2261d498c42cc6cf756c67286887137d8f98b54) as it can be handled by the normal damage rules.

- Power. The B-29 has four times the weight of a B-26 but only twice the power. I therefor assume half the power of the B-26 (so 0.5 at FT, regardless of configuration) and a similar fade above a speed of 2.5. This gives an acceleration of about 0.5 in four turns at speed 2.5 or less and 0.5 in eight turns at speed 3.0 or more.

- Cruise speed. Wikipedia gives a cruise speed of 220 mph, so I adopt 2.0.

- Climb speed. The "B-29 Combat Crew Manual" (referenced on the Wikipedia page) states on pages III-4 and III-5 that the optimum speed for climbing is 200 mph.

- Fuel consumption. I assume twice the fuel consumption of the B-26.

- Fuel. The SAC gives a maximum fuel of 54,900 lb = 2750 fuel points. At normal power, this gives an endurance of about 23 hours in good agreement with the SAC.

- Turns Rates. In [a27bf43](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/a27bf43c7f8096a1b6805103298aa698fdac79b3), I allow TT when CL and EZ otherwise. See the discussion in [[https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/wiki/ADCs — Bombers]]. I assume 1.0 DPs for this turn.

- Configurations. See the discussion below. 1 load point = 1000 lb or bombs or 50 fuel points. Then:
  - CL = 85,000 lb
  - 1/2 = about 100,000 lb
  - DT = 110,000 lb or more

- Range. With 10,000 lb bomb load and 25,000 ft bombing run = 1800 nm = 2000 miles. With 20,000 lb bomb load and 25,000 ft bombing run = 1400 nm = 1600 miles. In both case, the B-29 will be 1/2 just before dropping bombs and CL just after dropping bombs.

- We then have a ceiling (500 ft/m) of:
  - DT = 32 (since in the high mission bombs are dropped while DT at 30,000 ft)
  - 1/2 = 37
  - CL = 40

- Climb rate
  - 1/2 at SL = 1600 ft/min = 0.33 level/turn
  - 1/2 at 25,000 ft = 1300 ft/min = 0.26 level/turn
  - 1/2 at 30,000 ft = 1200 ft/min = 0.24 level/turn
  - CL at SL = 2140 ft/min = 0.43 level/turn
  - MTO at SL = 500 ft/min = 0.10 level/turn

- Dive Speeds. Since the aircraft can lose at most 1 altitude level per turn, the dive speed is irrelevant. 

- Max Speeds. Wikipedia states that the maximum speed is 357 mph. Speed from the SAC at combat weight (1/2)
  - 270 kt = 310 mph at LO (1-8) at 1/2
  - 290 kt = 330 mph at ML (9-16) at 1/2
  - 320 kt = 370 mph at MH (17-25) at 1/2
  - 340 kt = 390 mph at HI (26-35) at 1/2
  - 320 kt = 370 mph at VH (36-45) at 1/2

- Min Speeds. Wikipedia states that the stall speed is 100 mph. The SAC has the stall speed being 100 kn for MTOW. For other aircraft, this often increases by 0.5 going to HI/CL or DT/LO and something in between for 1/2.

- Climb Rate. Climb rate from SAC at combat weight (1/2)
  - 1250 ft/min = 0.25 at LO/ML/MH.
  - 1000 ft/min = 0.20 at HI.
  - 500  ft/min = 0.10 at VH
  Climb rate at MTOW (assume maximum power gives twice climb rate at normal power)
  - 1000 ft/min = 0.20 at LO
  - 500  ft/min = 0.10 at ML/MH
  Climb rate from SAC when CL:
  - 2140 ft/min = 0.40 at LO

- Bomb load. Maximum of 20,000 lb.
  - 4 x 4,000 lb GP
  - 8 x 2,000 lb GP (16 load points)
  - 12 x 1,600 lb AP
  - 12 x 1,000 lb GP (18 load points)
  - 40 x 500 lb GP (40 load points)

### Guns

The guns are specified as .50 cal M2 in [a991a31](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/a991a319883ecea905eb193d1c445657320b6e88) (Wikipedia). 

Third .50 cal in tail, replacing the 20 mm M2, added in [571fa22](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/571fa22f640b09fc04bc0c51e12ac17eb69bde2c) for Korean War aircraft (Dorr, ch. 1).

Dorr (ch. 1 and 2) shows photos of B-29s with forward dorsal turret with four guns.

All of the B-29s shown in color plates by Dorr have forward dorsal turrets with four guns.

### FTs

- The SAC shows the bomb-bay tanks as having a capacity of 1280 gal. They are actually two 640 gal tanks (Howett). Added in [12aad42](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/12aad420a4efb3e6b8635b402c7dd74a16acb645) and 
[81074b4](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/81074b4dc832c072a6a1c2d7110e5f6203f4b3b6).

### Radar

In the [radar maps](http://www.philcrowther.com/6thBG/6bgradar2.html) with the APG-13 shown by Crowther, the scale is about 5 miles between rings terrain can be seen to about 45 miles. Let's say: ECCM = 0, arc = 0+, search = 120, track = 60, lock-on = 6. Added in [ba2a6b5](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/ba2a6b5e8d33caa376f228634d77ca17c7316dd9).

### ECM

- RWR A seems about right. The jammer is probably a BJM. The only other aircraft I can find with one is the B-52 with B3. Since this jammer probably depends on power and the B-52 probably has a lot more, let's give A2 to the B-29. Added in [d7040ae](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/d7040ae9834e3540133b6b4af426e61abd1c0f0c).

### Silverplate

Little (ch. XI): 
- 46 aircraft were modified to carry atomic bombs by the end of WWII. No more modifications for about a year after the end of the war. 4 of the 46 were lost and 18 had been placed in storage. 19 more modified in 1947. 
- Code name Silverplate discontinues in May 1947 and replaced by Saddletree, which also encompassed B-36s and B-50s.
- Saddletree modifications included removing all guns except the tail guns.
- Further modification of 80 B-29s planned to be completed before end of 1948.
- Ruralist air-to-air refueling planned for 36 B-29s before end of 1948. Includes large single tank in bomb bay.
- Modifications completed for March 1949.

- Possible bombs:
  - [Mark 3 Fat Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man): 10,000 lb; from 1945; 120 produced.
  - [Mark 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_4_nuclear_bomb): 11,000 lb; from 1949; 500 produced.
  - [Mark 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_5_nuclear_bomb): 3,000 lb; from 1952; 140 produced.
  - [Mark 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_6_nuclear_bomb): 8,000 lb; from 1951; 1100 produced.
  - [Mark 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_8_nuclear_bomb): 3,000 lb; from 1952; 40 produced.

- The last Silverplate B-29s served as nuclear bombers until November 1951 (Wikipedia on Silverplate). They carried the Mark 3,  Mark 4, and Mark 6 bombs (Wikipedia on B-29). Added in [fc0046](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/fc0046fd927df930ad85cc07f1a1a45256c1dc93) and [5653814](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/5653814f77add8d22d7180b98aa06622e0774ed7).

- Guns. All but tail guns removed. The guns have 500 rounds each. At 600 RPM, this is 50 seconds so the ammunition is 25.0. Added in [Added ammunition.](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/a587e3dc71b96aecb5a5d3dcd82035e2156a05ab).

- Crew. Pilot, Copilot, Flight Engineer, Navigator, Bombardier, Weaponeer, Radio Operator, Radar Operator, Countermeasures Operator, and Tail Gunner (Howlett). Added in [46f9e00](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/46f9e00ecc3e8616cd611bdbc99184d1db9913d1).

- Armor and flight performance. The Silverplate aircraft had the four turrets and much armor removed. I have reduced the vulnerability to +1. To account for the improved performance, I have increased the configuration limits by 10 (i.e., equivalent to removing 10,000 lb), which will typically allow the aircraft to be 1/2 before dropping rather than DT. Added in [2717e79](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/2717e79a3cf7151b6185c50af6a32e8015844e31) and [378316b](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/378316b24102fcdfc64a5ac4a1d14e48fbd3fac7).

### Saddletree and Ruralist

According to Little (ch. XI), in 1948 and 1949, about 120 B-29s were modified to SADDLETREE standard. Of these, about half had IFR (RURALIST) and winterized electronics. SADDLETREE aircraft were stripped of the turrets and most armor and fitted for atomic bombs. RURALIST aircraft had a single large tank installed the bomb bay and probe refueling equipment.

I would suggest SADDLETREE is basically SILVERPLATE plus a possible IFR capability.

Added in [a26035](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/a260350fa32e66095e83e3fa885b9abbfabd9770).

### Ranges

- Yokota to Andung = 550 miles
- Kadena to Andung = 970 miles

The max bombs radius is 1600 miles, so B-29 missions in Korea could be max bombs. This is confirmed by some of the specific bomb loads mentioned by Dorr.

### Loads 

In the SAC, the combat weight is the weight over the target after dropping bombs.

- Basic mission: expend 28,500 lb of fuel to target, drop 10,000 lb bombs, expend 17,200 lb returning, have 4600 lb reserve. Load before dropping bombs is 31,800 lb. Load after is 21,800 lb.
- Max bombs mission: expend 23,100 lb of fuel to target, drop 20,000 lb of bombs, expend 13,400 lb returning, have 3700 lb reserve. Load before dropping bombs is 37,100 lb. Load after is 17,100 lb.
- Ferry: about 5,000 lb of fuel

Note that the load before and after dropping bombs changes only by about 5,000 lb. I propose that the scenario determine the load options, either explicitly or implicitly by giving a load-equivalent for the return fuel and we arrange the limits such that:

- Return mission: DT = before dropping, 1/2 = after dropping, CL = before landing
- One-way mission: 1/2 = before dropping, CL = after dropping

Using 1 load point = 1000 lb or 50 fuel points, we see:

- Basic: 31 before and 21 after
- Max bombs: 37 before and 17 after
- Ferry: 5

We therefore require:

- CL if < 12
- 1/2 if < 24

A typical return mission requires 15 points of fuel.

With this interpretation:

- DT = 110,000 lb or more
- 1/2 = combat weight for normal mission (about 95,000 to 105,000 lb)
- CL = combat weight for ferry mission (about 85,000 lb)

Implemented in [629e15e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/629e15e63b26d98343d38dc14a601caa492a45c3).
