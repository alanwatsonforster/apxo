## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

Original ADCs for F-84E/G from TSOH.

### Guns

Six .50 cal M3 guns each with 300 rounds (Wikipedia). Specified as M3 in [2261538](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/2261538f1aad8ceb7c10520a94e0a1ccf0629e24).

### Radar

Radar is APG-30 (Wikipedia). Added in [a7bfe91](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/a7bfe91ab4b0e7addfc9592e911c051cb3620d36).

### FTs

Wing-tip tanks are 226 gal (850L). Under-wing stations can carry 230 gal (850L) FTs (Wikipedia, Goebel).

### Air-to-Air Refueling

Cleaver, ch. 13: F-84E could be equipped with an air-to-air refueling probe. This was used in May 1952 to strike targets in North Korea from Japan. Refueling was provided by B-29 tankers. The load was two 500 lb bombs.

### Loads

Cleaver:
- ch. 3: underwing pylons could carry 2000 lb; flush-fitting rocket racks.
- ch. 13: two 500 lb or two 1000 lb bombs.

Goebel: 
- F-84E could carry 4500 lb
- F-84E used rockets, bombs, and napalm
- F-84E was at the limit with two 1000 lb bombs
- F-84G could carry 4000 lb of conventional ordnance
- F-84G could use the 1200 lb Mk 7 tactical nuclear bomb and had LABS for toss bombing.

Jackson:
- p. 67: photo of 1000 lb bomb (size of man) being loaded onto an F-84
- p. 69: photo of F-84 with two 500 lb bombs
- p. 89: photo of F-84 with two 1000? lb bombs (despite the caption)
- p. 109: photo of F-84 with two 1000? lb bombs

F-84G can carry a Mk 7 nuclear bomb (Wikipedia). I presume on stations 4 or 5.

### Reconnaissance Pods

Gobel: Wing-tip tanks could be replaced by camera pods. Used by Belgium (G), Denmark (G), France (G), Italy (G), Netherlands (E), Norway (E), and Yugoslavia (G).

## Other Possible Variants

### F-84D

Cleaver (ch. 13) states that 102 F-84Ds were sent to Korea in 1952 and were used by the 136th Wing from April to October 1952.
