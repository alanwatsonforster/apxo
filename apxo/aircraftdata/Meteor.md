# Meteor

## ADCs

- [Meteor F.8](Meteor%20F.8.json)
- [Meteor FR.9](Meteor%20FR.9.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

ADCs for the F.8 and FR-9 appear in APJ 50.

### Blind Arc

The blind arc might better be 30L rather than 30-.

### Typical Loads

- Centerline conformal 175 gal (800L) fuel tank (weight 1600, load 3.0 full and 2.0 empty, and 70 fuel points).
- 100 gal (455L) fuel tanks on stations 1 and 3 (each weight 900, load 2.5 full and 1.5 empty, and 39 fuel points)
- Two 1000 lb bombs (on stations 1 and 3)
- Eight or sixteen RP-3 rockets (on stations 4–11)

Stations 1 and 3 and stations 4-11 cannot be used simultaneously.

The centerline tank was used in Korea (photo in Wikipedia).

According to Wilson, the ventral fuel tank was regarded as a weakness during ground attack operations by No. 77 Squadron RAAF in Korea:
- On 9th. March 1952, Sergeant Cranston was killed whilst making a second rocket pass on a target in North Korea. Hit in the vulnerable ventral tank, the Meteor caught fire and crashed before Cranston could eject.
- Another pilot managed to jettison his flaming tank.

Photo on page 29 of “Swift to Destroy” shows armorers with 60lb HE rockets.

Photo on page 33 of “Swift to Destroy” shows an RAAF Meteor with the ventral tank and sixteen rockets (apparently RP-3) on dual rails. The caption states that dual rails were in short supply.

## Possible Additional Versions

- PR.10.
- NF.11.
  - AI Mk.10 (US SCR-720B) radar (Goebel/White)
- NF.12: 
  - AI MK.21 (APS-57) radar (White)
- NF.13: 
  - Tropicalized NF.12 (Goebel/White)
- NF.14: 
  - NF.11 with different canopy and longer nose.
  - What says APS-57 radar. Gobel says AN/APS-21 radar, but this seems to be a confusion with the Mk.21 radar.

## Operational History

Used by No. 77 Squadron RAAF in Korea from July 1951 (Wikipedia).
