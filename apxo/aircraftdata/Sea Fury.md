# Sea Fury

## ADCs

- [Sea Fury FB.11](Sea%20Fury%20FB.11.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Original ADC

An ADC for the FB.11 appears in APJ 32. 

### Restricted Arc

Restricted arc changed to 180L in [3a1bd42](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/3a1bd42f22d1a9c44ca8afdfb01578f9580949f4).

### Loads

Typical air-to-ground loads:

- 12 x [RP-3 rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-3) (two each on stations 5â€“10)
- 500 lb or 1000 lb bombs (one each on stations 1 and 4)
- 1000 lb incendiary bombs (one each on stations 1 and 4)
- 90 gal (400L) fuel tanks (one each on stations 2 and 3)

Stations 1 and 4 and stations 5-10 cannot be used simultaneously.

## Other Versions

- F.10 seems to the FB.11 without the under-wing stores or perhaps with stations 1-4 but not the stations for rockets and with less armor.

## Operational History

In service with RN in August 1947 (BAE).

The Sea Fury FB.11 saw service in the Korean War from October 1950 onwards, with both the RN and RAN, and in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, with the FAR (Wikipedia).
