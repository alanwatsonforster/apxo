## Notes and Changes

### Original ADC

APJ 50 has an ADC for the -9D.

### Vulnerability

The vulnerability with extra fuel should be -2, not +2 (fixed in [0d47a6e](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/0d47a6e3a58299644825bf1d6405d230743c1a48)).

### Yak-9T

This seems to be an early version, similar to the -9D but without the extended range and with a 37 mm NS-37 gun instead of the 20 mm gun (Airpages.ru).

### Yak-9U

There seems to have been two Yak-9Us: one prototype with the VK-105PF engine and one that reached production with VK-107A. Both were aremed with a 20 mm ShVAK and two 12.7 mm UBS with 170 rounds each. 

The performance was slightly better to previous versions; the records reported in some places were set by a lightened and specially prepared aircraft (Airpages.ru). Speed at sea level was 360 mph and at 16,000 ft was again 360 mph (slightly faster than the -D) and the ceiling was 35,000 ft (somewhat more than the 30,000 ft of the -D) (Airpages.ru). 

I added a -9U in [c705135](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c7051355df7d7c981cb48046d6883e7ba459aa24). It is based in the -9D, but with an extra machine gun (that increase the damage from 2/2* to 3/3*, perhaps somewhat generously) and without the note on fuel.

### Yak-9P

The -9P seems to have been a -9U with all-metal wings (Wikipedia).

I added a -9U in [94843bc](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/94843bc0c4b4e70d8a669ec2de628d24c948e3e5).

### Versions used by KPAAF

- Yak-9U and -9P (Seidov).  Seidov also says a -9T was captured at Kimpo, but then says it had a VK-107A engine, which would make it a -9U or -9P. O'Malley says it was a -9U, and the photograph seems to confirm it was a -9U or -9P. See also Aeroflight.co.uk.

### Stores

The APJ 50 ADC for the -9D has two stations for 225 lb BBs. I have seen no photographic or written evidence in support of the Yak-9 carrying bombs, except for the -T and -B.

### Guns

Wikipedia states that the 12.7 mm UBS had a rate of fire of 700-800 RPM when used synchronously. The 240 rounds of the -9D then correspond to an ammunition of 9.6 and the 170 rounds per gun of the -9U/-9P to 6.8.

Wikipedia states that the 20 m ShVAK has a rate of fire of 700-800 RPM when used asynchronously. The 120 rounds then corresponds to an ammunition of 4.8.
