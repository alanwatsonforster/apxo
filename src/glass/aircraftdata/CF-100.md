# CF-100

## ADCs

- [CF-100 Mk 4B](CF-100%20Mk%204B.json)
- [CF-100 Mk 5](CF-100%20Mk%205.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

APJ 14 contains ADCs for the Mk. 4B and Mk 5.

### Rocket Pods

The original ADCs assign 2 factors of rockets to the pods on the Mk 4B but 4.5 to the pods on the Mk 5. This seems to be an error, as both carry 29 FFARs in each pod (Wikipedia). 

The conversion rate is given as 10 rockets = 1 factor in the rules, and the conversion factor for other similar aircraft (F-86D/L 24 rockets = 2.0 factors, F-89D/J 104 rockets = 9.0 factors, F-89H 42 rockets = 4.0 factors, and F-8C 32 rockets = 3.0 factors) is 10.5 to 12.0. It seems more fair to round 29 rockets up to 3.0 factors than down to 2.0 factors. Changed in [26377ec](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/26377ec40a476f81a48308d20d9253c0001e4c52).

## Other Versions

- CF-100 Mk 3A/3B. Armament is eight .50 cal machine guns in a forward-firing ventral pack (Wikipedia), like the Mk 4B.
- CF-100 Mk 4A. Like the 4B, but powered by Orenda 9 rather than Orenda 11 engines (Wikipedia).
- CF-100 Mk 5M. Small number of Mk 5s equipped to carry the Sparrow II (Wikipedia).
- CF-100 Mk 6. Proposed version armed with Sparrow II missiles (Wikipedia). Not built.
